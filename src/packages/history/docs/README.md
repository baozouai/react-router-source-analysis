Welcome to the history docs!

The history library lets you easily manage session history anywhere JavaScript
runs. A `history` object abstracts away the differences in various environments
and provides a minimal API that lets you manage the history stack, navigate, and
persist state between sessions.

The library is very small, so there are really just a few files here for you to
browse.

If this is your first time here, we'd recommend you start with the [Getting
Started](getting-started.md) guide.

You may also be interested in reading one of the following guides:

- [Installation](installation.md)
- [Navigation](navigation.md)
- [Blocking Transitions](blocking-transitions.md)

An [API Reference](api-reference.md) is also available.
